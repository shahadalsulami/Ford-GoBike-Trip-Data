# Exploratory Data Analysis of Ford GoBike Trip Data

## Introduction:
This analysis focuses on the concept of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The goal is to explore how trip duration varies by factors such as age, user type, gender, and day of the week, aiming to uncover patterns in bike usage and user behavior

## Requirements:
- **pandas:** for data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy:** for performing numerical and mathematical operations
- **matplotlib:** for creating visualizations and plots
- **seaborn:**  for advanced visualizations
